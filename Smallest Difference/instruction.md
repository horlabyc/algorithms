## SMALLEST DIFFERENCE

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers, find the pair of numbers(one from each array)
whose absolute difference is closest to zero and returns an array containing these twonumbers, with the number
from the first array in the first position.

Note that the absolute difference of two integers is the distance between them in the real number line. For
example, the absolute difference of -5 and 5 is 10, and the absolute difference of -5 and -4 is 1.

You can assume that there will only be one pair of numbers with the smallest difference

 ### Sample Input
```js
arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]
arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]
```

### Sample Output
```js
 [28, 26]
```
